# fcc_donation_popup_blocker

***This does not currently work, it is a work in progress***

A Chrome extension that blocks the donation pop-up on freeCodeCamp. The intent is to remove the donation pop ups that happen every so many exercises until you donate. This is currently a work in progress and my own solo project.

Note: freeCodeCamp is indeed free. If fCC has or is helping you learn - I highly advise that you make whatever donation you can. Servers are not free to host!
